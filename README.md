# Vehicle_Collision_Detection
This research explores a YOLO model system for advanced driver-assistance. It aims to enhance safety by detecting cars, pedestrians, and obstacles, differentiating sidewalks/crosswalks from roads, recognizing traffic signals, marking road lanes, and estimating distances. The model boasts an 87% accuracy in preventing vehicle collisions.
